# rosbag_to_dataset
A library that converts rosbags into datasets for intervention learning, model-based RL, and online learning.

## Spec Format
The user is required to provide the converters a YAML file that describes the format of the robot data to convert and run learning on. This YAML file can be proken into three components:

    1. main_topic: other topics will be temporally aligned with the main_topic, according to its time stamps
    2. Timestep (dt): the frequency of the extracted data
    3. data: topics of interests
        - <topic-name>:
            * type: <topic-type>
            * folder: <output-folder>
            * N_per_step: <higher-freq-ratio>
            * options:
                <option-1>: <value-1>

Examples of this yaml format can be found in ```specs/sample_tartandrive.yaml```.

### Modalities
This library currently supports the following modalities (more will be added as needed by our experiments). Note that we generally want our messages to be timestamped.

    - AckermannDriveStamped
    - BoolStamped
    - CompressedImage
    - Float64
    - Image
    - Imu
    - Odometry
    - PointCloud
    - PoseStamped
    - TwistStamped
    - Vector3


## Output format
Data of specified modalities is stored in trajectory folders with the following format:

```
ROOT
|
--- TRAJ_NAME_0                 # trajectory folder
|       |
|       +--- image_left         # 000000.png - 000xxx.png 
|       +--- image_right        # 000000.png - 000xxx.png 
|       +--- image_left_color   # 000000.png - 000xxx.png
|       +--- depth_left         # 000000.npy - 000xxx.npy
|       +--- height_map         # 000000.npy - 000xxx.npy
|       +--- rgb_map            # 000000.npy - 000xxx.npy
|       +--- cmd                # twist.npy
|       +--- imu                # imu.npy
|       +--- odom               # odometry.npy
|       +--- tartanvo_odom      # motions.npy, poses.npy
|       +--- points_left        # 000000.npy - 000xxx.npy
|       
+-- TRAJ_NAME_1
.
.
|
+-- TRAJ_NAME_N
```

Note that inside each modality folder, there is a `timestamps.txt` file, specifying the corresponding timestamps of each frame. 

## Extracting data from bagfiles

To generate data for *a single bagfile*, do the following:

```
python scripts/tartandrive_dataset.py --bag_fp <ARG> --config_spec <ARG> --save_to <ARG>
```

Args

    --config_spec: path to the configuration file

    --bag_fp: path to bagfile

    --save_to: new dir to save data files in

To process *multiple bagfiles* at once, you can first generate a text file with a list of input bagfiles and output folder:

```
<Full path of the bagfile 0> <Output folder name 0>
<Full path of the bagfile 1> <Output folder name 1>
<Full path of the bagfile 2> <Output folder name 2>
...
```

To generate the above text file, you can refer to the script file `scripts/preprocess_dataset.py`. 

And run the following command: 
```
python scripts/tartandrive_dataset.py --bag_list <ARG> --config_spec <ARG> --save_to <ARG>
```

Args

    --config_spec: path to the configuration file

    --bag_list: path to text file listing multiple bagfiles and output folders

    --save_to: new dir to save all the trajectories in

## TartanVO and local mapping

To generate top-down maps offline in the cases that the bagfile does not already contain them, run the `scripts/tartandrive_postprocessing.py`, which calls the functions under `post_processing` folder. 

Environment setup: 

```
cd src/rosbag_to_dataset/post_processing/tartanvo
sh download_models.sh
cd ../mapping
python setup.py built_ext --inplace
```

Run the mapping code: 

```
python scripts/tartandrive_postprocessing.py --root <ARG> --bag_list <ARG> --vo --stereo --mapping
```

Args

    --root: path to the data folder, generated from the last step

    --bag_list: same file used in the last step, listing bagfiles and the output directories. 
    
    --vo: generate odometry result
    
    --stereo: generate stereo matching result
    
    --mapping: generate height map and rgb map.

Mapping parameters: 

There are many parameters for the stereo matching, visual odometry and mapping modules. Please look into `src/rosbag_to_dataset/post_processing/tartanvo/arguments.py` and `src/rosbag_to_dataset/post_processing/mapping/arguments.py`. 

## Code Notes
This code is derived from the Tartan_cost branch. The main feature is to store the data into files instead of returning as numpy array. Another key change is the way of aligning the timestamps. A main-topic is defined in the spec file, other topics are aligned with the main-topic by finding the msg with the closest timestamps. 

## TODO:

* Extract data based on a existing timestamps.txt, which allows us to extract new data while still synchronized with the existing ones.
* Support and test new modalities, such as intervention signal, top-down maps, pointcloud, etc.
